This demo app uses the following techniques to build a new SwiftUI Composable Architecture.

1. Harvest (Elm-like Architecture)
2. Optics (Lenses and Prisms)
3. Store.Proxy (easy 2-way-binding with SwiftUI)

Please check that this whole app is based on `Store` as a single source of truth, and Optics helps decoupling of each screen's `State`, `Input` (Action), and `EffectMapping` (Reducer) in a elegant way.

If you are not familiar with "Elm" or "Lenses and Prisms", go google these words to start diving into Functional Programming!
